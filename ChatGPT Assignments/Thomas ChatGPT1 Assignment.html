    <h3>Accidental Additional Use of Additional GPT-3 Model: Github Copilot</h3>
    <p>
        Our discussions about ChatGPT reminded me to enable Github Copilot. Github
        Copilot is a language generation model for programmers that is built off of
        the GPT-3 language model, and GPT-3 (specifically GPT-3.5) is the same model
        used to make the basic form of ChatGPT (ChatGPT Plus uses the new GPT-4
        model). Throughout the process of starting my blog, I began sketching out
        HTML pages in a <a href="https://github.com/sedona-thomas/Big-Data-and-Data-Processing-Blog">
            Github repository</a> that I would then copy over to Scalar. Entirely unintentionally,
        after writing a few pages with my bio and goals for the project, Copilot began
        suggesting entire paragraphs of text that sounded reasonable for my intended
        content. Even as I was typing this paragraph, Copilot kept suggesting possible
        ways to continue, two of which I have copied below. As a computer scientist,
        I am familiar with the abilities and limitations of these kinds of models,
        but even I was extremely impressed with the outputs since the Copilot program
        is intended to write code, not text.

        would suggest a line of code that would complete the HTML tag. I was surprised
