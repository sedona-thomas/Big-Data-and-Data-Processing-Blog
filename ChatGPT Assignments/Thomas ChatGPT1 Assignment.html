Instructions: 








Use block quote format to highlight question response. 

When reporting the ChatGPT responses, you can often omit the initial and final paragraphs if they are repetitious or superfluous.

Point to the critical observations in the ChatGPT response by using italics, bold, and color 

If you found ChatGPT very helpful and/or are just feeling expansive, you can create a path under your main response and dedicate each page on that path to a particular chat question. You can also add notes to these passages as well.  

After you have completed, please be sure to add a tag and make sure it is on the proper paths.
