<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>
    Hello! I am Sedona (she/her), a dual B.S./B.A student at Columbia University. My
    Bachelor of Science was in computer science with a focus on the variety of applications
    of computer technologies, and I am currently finishing up my Bachelor of Arts in human
    rights with a senior thesis on discrmination in predictive policing software. I am
    extremely interested in the intersection of these fields, specifically regarding how we
    can mitigate the effects of algorithmic discrimination.

<h2>Adovcacy Campaign</h2>

<p>
    This advocacy campaign will focus on the effects of mass data collection across domains
    of computer science, including artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and
    computer vision. As the use of artificial intelligence has become more widespread, there
    are significant misconceptions about the capabilities and limitations of these technologies.
    With my background in computer science and experience with software development, I am in
    the unique position to help contexualize misconceptions about these technologies and
    highlight the significant limitations in the regulations of digital systems.
