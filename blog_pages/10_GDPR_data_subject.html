<h2>The Data Subject</h2>

<p>
    One of the most significant aspects of the GDPR is the creation of the <em>data subject</em>.
    The GDPR defines <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/">data subjects</a> as:
</p>
<blockquote>
    an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly,
    in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number,
    location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical,
    physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural
    person
</blockquote>
<p>
    In other words, data subjects are and individual people who can be identified in some way by
    data collected about them. Notably, the GDPR does not require that data subjects be entirely
    uniquely or accurately identified by their data and identification can include a wide range of
    information, including broader categories such as cultural or social identities.
</p>

<h2>Consent of the Data Subject</h2>
<p>
    One of the most significant rights established for the data subject is the right to consent for
    the collection, use, and storage of their data. The GDPR defines the conditions for consent under
    <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-7-gdpr/">Article 7</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the
            data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also
            concerns other matters, the request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is
            clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible
            form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an
            infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal
            of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
            Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw
            as to give consent.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter
            alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent
            to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.
        </li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
    In other words, consent must be:
</p>
<ol style="margin-left: 25px;">
    <li>given before data is processed</li>
    <li>can only be given when the data subject is fully informed of how their data will be used</li>
    <li>can be withdrawn at any time</li>
    <li>cannot be a condition of a contract where the processing of personal data is not necessary for the contract</li>
</ol>
