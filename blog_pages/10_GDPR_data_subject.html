<h2>The Data Subject</h2>
<div class="section">
    <p>
        One of the most significant aspects of the GDPR is the creation of the <em>data subject</em>.
        The GDPR defines <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/">data subjects</a> as:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly,
        in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number,
        location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical,
        physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural
        person
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        In other words, data subjects are and individual people who can be identified in some way by 
        data collected about them.  Notably, the GDPR does not require that data subjects be entirely 
        uniquely or accurately identified by their data and identification can include a wide range of
        information, including broader categories such as cultural or social identities.
