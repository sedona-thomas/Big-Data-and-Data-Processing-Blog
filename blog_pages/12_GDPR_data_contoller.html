<h2>The Right to Be Informed</h2>
<p>
    One of the most significant data rights that have been established by the GDPR is the
    <em>right to be informed</em> which must be ensured by data controllers. The right to be 
    informed is a data subject's right to know what data is being collected about them, how it
