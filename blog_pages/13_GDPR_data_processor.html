<h2>The Data Processor</h2>
<p>
    The GDPR defines <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/">data processors</a> as:
</p>
<blockquote>
    'processor' means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body
    which processes personal data on behalf of the controller
</blockquote>
<p>
    Data processors can include cloud service providers, data analytics companies, tech
    companies, and even individuals. Data processors act under the direct instruction of
    data controllers and
    <a href="https://www.gdpreu.org/the-regulation/key-concepts/data-controllers-and-processors/">
        do not have the same level of responsibility as data controllers under the GDPR</a>.
    However, data processors are still required to comply with the GDPR and can be held
    accountable for violations of data subjects' rights under the GDPR.
</p>

<p>
    It must also be noted that a single entity cannot be classified as
    <a

        both a data controller and data processor</a>.
    If a single entity acts as both a controller and processor, they are subject to the
    <a href="https://www.gdpreu.org/the-regulation/key-concepts/data-controllers-and-processors/">
        stricter requirements of a data controller</a>.
</p>

<h2>Data Brokers and the GDPR</h2>
<p>
    Data brokers function as a form of data controller since they aggrgate large amounts of personal data, 
    despite the fact that the GDPR does not directly address the issue of selling data. However, outside of the 
    European Union, data brokers are rarely—if ever—subject to limitations on how, when, and to whom they can sell
    personal data, leaving data subjects especially vulnerable when they are unable to find out where their data is 
    being distributed, how their data is being process, and what protections—or lack thereof—are in place.
