<h2>The Right to Be Informed</h2>
<p>
    One of the most significant data rights that have been established by the GDPR is the
    <em>right to be informed</em> which must be ensured by data controllers. The right to be
    informed is a data subject's right to know what data is being collected about them, how it
    is being used, and how long it will be retained. This information must be provided in
    <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-12-gdpr/">"in a concise, transparent, intelligible
        and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in particular for any
        information addressed specifically to a child".</a>
</p>

<p>
    The GDPR defines the right to be informed under articles 12-14:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-12-gdpr/">Article 12</a>: Transparent information,
        communication and modalities for the exercise of the rights of the data subject
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-13-gdpr/">Article 13</a>: Information to be provided
        where personal data are collected from the data subject
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-14-gdpr/">Article 14</a>: Information to be provided
        where personal data have not been obtained from the data subject
    </p>
