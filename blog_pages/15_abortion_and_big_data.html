<h2>Abortion in the United States</h2>
<p>
    With the overturn of Roe v. Wade in June of 2022 and the rise of anti-abortion legislation
    in the following months, women in the United States have lost significant protections to
    their reproductive autonomy and overall health. <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/70-18">
        Roe v. Wade</a> was initially decided in 1973,
    <a
        href="https://www.usg.edu/galileo/skills/unit07/internet07_02.phtml#:~:text=January%201%2C%201983%20is%20considered,Protocol%20(TCP%2FIP).">
        a decade before the Internet was invented</a>.
    The Internet has signficiantly changed the way we live our lives and poses previously
    unimaginable risks to women's reproductive autonomy throughout the United States due to the
    types of data being collected about them and the ability of legislators to access this data.

<h2>Period Tracking Apps and Sensitive Health Data</h2>
<p>
    Period tracking apps have gained popularity since their appearance in smartphone app stores by the
    early 2010s (I have personally used these apps for over 15 years and witnessed their evolution
    first-hand). Some of the main period tracking apps include
    <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clue-period-tracker-calendar/id657189652">Clue</a>,
    <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flo-period-tracker-calendar/id1038369065">Flo</a>, and
    <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/period-tracker-eve/id1002275138">Eve</a>.
</p>

<h3>Types of Data Tracked</h3>
<p>
    Some of the main concerns about period tracking apps are the types of data that they collect. The main
    purpose of these apps is to track menstrual cycles, but they also allow users to track highly detailed
    data about sexual activity, mood, pain levels, and other health information.

<h3>Voluntary Disclosure of Data</h3>
<p>
    A major concern about users' perception of menstrual tracking apps—and health tracking apps in
    general—is that users are unaware that they are voluntarily disclosing their health data to the apps
    and that this data is not protected by privacy legislation for health data such as
    <a
        href="https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/hipaa.html#:~:text=The%20Health%20Insurance%20Portability%20and,the%20patient's%20consent%20or%20knowledge.">HIPPA</a>.
    This is a major concern because the data collected by these apps is highly sensitive and is being actively
    bought and sold by third party data brokers.

<p>
    In the aftermath of Dobbs v. Jackson, Flo's Data Protection Officer, Susanne Schumacher, <a
        href="https://flo.health/press-center/flo-launches-anonymous-mode">claimed</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
    Flo will never share or sell user data, and only collects data when we have a legal basis to do so and when our
    users have given their informed consent. Any data we do collect is fully encrypted, and this will never change.
</blockquote>
<p>
    However, Flo has been <a
        href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/06/ftc-finalizes-order-flo-health-fertility-tracking-app-shared-sensitive-health-data-facebook-google">caught
        selling user data to third party data marketing and analytics firms, including Facebook and Google</a>. The FTC
    finalized a settlement in 2021 for Flo's deceptive practices that
    <a
        href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/01/developer-popular-womens-fertility-tracking-app-settles-ftc-allegations-it-misled-consumers-about">
        misled users about the disclosure of their health data</a>,
    which included sharing sensitive health data with third parties without users' knowledge or consent. This is
    especially concerning since Flo has
    <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/flo-gets-ftc-slap-for-sharing-user-data-when-it-promised-privacy/">over
        100 million users</a>.
    This use of dark design patterns strongly violates the rights of data subjects since they were not informed about
    the use of their data, did not consent to their data being used in this way, and were not given the
    option to opt out of this data collection. Of a similar concern, the Wall Street Journal first identified
    Flo's practice of selling user data <a
        href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-give-apps-sensitive-personal-information-then-they-tell-facebook-11550851636">in
        2019</a>.
    The most significant concern of this data collection in a post-Roe world is the ability of law enforcement
    to use this data to criminalize abortion. Data brokers are often indiscrminate in who they sell data to and
    often <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/12/21/data-brokers-privacy-federal-government-00072600">sell
        directly to the United States government</a>. This means that the data collected by Flo could be used
    by prosecutors as evidence of criminal abortions. This is especially concerning since data aquired by data
    brokers is

        vulnerable populations</a>.
</p>

<h2>Location Data and Abortion</h2>
<p>
    Similar concerns have been raised about the use of ridesharing apps and the legal pressure to disclose
    data as evidence of criminal abortions. In 2019, the New York Times <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html">published
        an article</a> about the use of location data from apps such as Uber and Lyft to track the daily movements of over 12 million Americans. Concerns about the use of this data are not unfounded. Prior to 2016, Uber contained a developer feature called <a
        href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2016/01/06/uber-settles-god-view-allegations/78383276/">Uber God
        Mode</a> that allowed employees to view any user's location data in real time. This feature was used to track
    the <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/a8495499/uber-using-god-view-tool-to-spy-on-celebs/">location of
        celebrities and journalists</a> and was also used to track the <a
        href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/19/7245447/uber-allegedly-tracked-journalist-with-internal-tool-called-god-view">location
        of a journalist who was critical of Uber's business practices</a>. Uber <a
        href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/6/10726004/uber-god-mode-settlement-fine">settled a lawsuit with the
        FTC</a> in 2016
    for $20 million for the use of employees' "God View" mode.
</p>

<p>
    Companies have already begun voluntarily selling data <a
        href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7vzjb/location-data-abortion-clinics-safegraph-planned-parenthood">about
        people who have visited abortion clinics</a>, and the collection of this data is further concerning since
    governments could require the disclosure of
    this data as evidence in criminal investigations.
