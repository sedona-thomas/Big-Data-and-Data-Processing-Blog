    <h2>Strategy</h2>
    <p>
        My strategy is twofold:
    <ol>
        <li>Learn more about how useful answers are based on how questions are structured</li>
        <li>Learn more about the programming abilities of ChatGPT/GPT-3 </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        The first part of my strategy was developed to formalize some things I noticed in
        personal tests of ChatGPT. Before this assignment, I was personally testing out the
        capabilities of ChatGPT. I was specifically using it to suggest alternative phrasings
        of text for an essay, essentially treating it as a more complicated thesaurus. Through
        these tests, while many individual requests were not helpful or seemed to misinterpret
        the questions, I noticed that explicitly requesting multiple responses seemed to
        improved the overall quality of the responses and revealed the patterns that ChatGPT
        was recognizing.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second part of my strategy was developed after I accidentally caused Github Copilot
        (another application of ChatGPT's underlying language model [GPT-3]) to try to write by
        blog pages (see <a href="#copilot">discussion below</a>). I had installed Github Copilot
        for personal use while programming, but it automatically started suggesting text for my
        blog pages and, while writing this post, it is still suggesting ways to finish my sentences.
        I decided to specifically test how well ChatGPT could write code to solve niche programming
        problems since I had already intended to write a program to fix Kumu Blueprint files. I have
        also noted places throughout this post where Github Copilot made suggestions to my writing that
        seemed particularly interesting.

                <p>
                    <b>Query:</b> Who are the rights violators in big data and data processing?
                </p>
                <blockquote cite="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">
                    There are several actors that can potentially violate
                    the rights of individuals in the context of big data and data processing.
                    Here are a few examples:
                    <br /><br />
                    <b>Companies:</b> Companies that collect and use data may violate individuals'
                    privacy rights if they do not obtain appropriate consent or if they use
                    data in ways that are not consistent with the purposes for which it was
                    collected.
                    <br /><br />
                    <b>Governments:</b> Governments may violate individuals' privacy rights if they
                    collect and use data without appropriate legal authority, or if they use
                    data in ways that are not consistent with privacy laws or human rights
                    standards.
                    <br /><br />
                    <b>Data processors:</b> Companies that process data on behalf of others may
                    violate individuals' privacy rights if they do not adequately protect
                    the data or if they use the data in ways that are not consistent with
                    the purposes for which it was collected.
                    <br /><br />
                    <b>Hackers:</b> Individuals or groups who gain unauthorized access to data can
                    violate individuals' privacy rights by disclosing or misusing sensitive
                    information.
                    <br /><br />
                    <b>Third-party service providers:</b> Service providers that work with companies
                    or governments may also be responsible for violating individuals' privacy
                    rights if they do not comply with privacy laws or data protection standards.
                    <br /><br />
                    It is important to note that the specific actors that may violate individuals'
                    privacy rights in the context of big data and data processing will vary
                    depending on the particular circumstances and the legal and regulatory
                    frameworks that apply.

                    I was impressed by the specificity of the response. It was clear that ChatGPT was
                    able to identify the patterns in its training data about the common entities that
                    violate data rights. I was also impressed by the fact that ChatGPT was able to order
                    them such that companies, governments, and data processors were listed first. This
                    likely indicates that these are the main entities discussed in cases of data rights
                    violations.

                    ChatGPT was clearly able to identify actions that were taken to protect data rights. It
                    interpreted the question as asking about advocacy groups, design techniques, and legislative
                    actions. Notably, its inclusion of <q><a href="#PbD">Privacy by Design</a></q> is the only framing
                    strategy while the others are tangible actions (non-profits or legislation).

                </p>
                <blockquote cite="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">
                    The United Nations recognizes the importance of digital privacy and has taken several steps to
                    address it. The UN General Assembly has recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental human
                    right, enshrined in Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

                    In addition, the United Nations has established several initiatives to promote digital privacy and
                    protect individuals from data breaches and abuses. For example:

                    In 2015, the UN adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes a target to
                    "significantly reduce illicit financial and arms flows, strengthen the recovery and return of stolen
                    assets and combat all forms of organized crime."

                    The United Nations also established the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which has
                    a mandate to promote and protect human rights, including the right to privacy.

                    The UN has also created the Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy, who is responsible for
                    examining and reporting on issues related to digital privacy.

                    The UN has also adopted various treaties and conventions related to privacy, such as the
                    International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child,
                    which include provisions related to the protection of personal data and the right to privacy.

                    In summary, the United Nations recognizes the importance of digital privacy and has taken several
                    steps to promote and protect this fundamental right.

                    the "kumu blueprint" portion of the query as a name or title and still try to solve
                    the problem. The apparent "self-awareness" of the model indicates that this form of
                    response was added to the underlying language model in some way. The developers could
                    have specified what to do when uncertain about a solution, provided examples of responses
                    for queries related to code generation, or even added an explicit "fallback" response
                    that would be returned when the model is unable to generate a solution. (Notably, the wording of
                    "even added an explicit "fallback" response that would be returned when the model is
                    unable to generate a solution" was explicitly suggested by the Github Copilot before I was
                    able to type something to the same effect.)

                    a unique id if it's a duplicate, writes the fixed JSON file back to
                    disk, and validates the JSON syntax using the json.loads() function.
                    If there's a JSON syntax error, the code will print an error message.

    <h3>Discussion</h3>
    <p>
        When initially using ChatGPT prior to this assignment, I was impressed with the improvements
        between it and many other prior chatbots, but I was not surprised by the results of the general
        questions for this assignment. However, I was quite impressed with the handling of the programming
        queries. I was not expecting the model to be able to generate code that was instantly usable or only
        required minor debugging. This is particularly notable because language models like GPT-3 are typically only
        usable by computer programmers unless they are programmed for a specific domain. For general queries,
        ChatGPT is effective at generating many responses that can be filtered down or edited by a human to make
        them more applicable to the user's needs. However, for more specific queries, ChatGPT sometimes generates
        responses that do not fulfill the user's intentions or interpret the question too literally.
    </p>

    <h3 id="copilot">Accidental Additional Use of Additional GPT-3 Model: Github Copilot</h3>
    <p>
        Our discussions about ChatGPT reminded me to enable Github Copilot. Github
        Copilot is a language generation model for programmers that is built off of
        the GPT-3 language model, and GPT-3 (specifically GPT-3.5) is the same model
        used to make the basic form of ChatGPT (ChatGPT Plus uses the new GPT-4
        model). Throughout the process of starting my blog, I began sketching out
        HTML pages in a <a href="https://github.com/sedona-thomas/Big-Data-and-Data-Processing-Blog">
            Github repository</a> that I would then copy over to Scalar. Entirely unintentionally,
        after writing a few pages with my bio and goals for the project, Copilot began
        suggesting entire paragraphs of text that sounded reasonable for my intended
        content. Even as I was typing this paragraph, Copilot kept suggesting possible
        ways to continue, two of which I have copied below. As a computer scientist,
        I am familiar with the abilities and limitations of these kinds of models,
        but even I was extremely impressed with the outputs since the Copilot program
        is intended to write code, not text.
    </p>

    <p>
        I also wanted to note that tools like Copilot and ChatGPT will soon be built into commonplace software.
        For example, just last week, Microsoft announced that they are in the process of integrating <a
            href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-a-whole-new-way-to-work/">
            a similar tool</a> to Github Copilot into the entire Microsoft Office Suite in the next few months.
        Unlike Github Copilot, this tool will assist in writing documents, emails, and other text-based content
        and will make it even more difficult to identify what is written by a human and what is written by a
        machine.
