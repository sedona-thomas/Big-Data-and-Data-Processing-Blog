        ChatGPT was queried to identify commonalities in how big data is described and returned the following:

            <b>Query:</b> What is big data?
        </p>
        <blockquote cite="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">
            Big data refers to extremely large and complex sets of data that cannot be easily processed using
            traditional data processing methods. The term "big data" typically refers to data sets that are so
            large, diverse, and fast-changing that they require advanced computational and analytical tools to
            process, store, and manage effectively.

            Big data often comes from multiple sources, such as social media, online transactions, sensors, and
            other digital sources. It can be structured, unstructured, or semi-structured, and may include a
            variety of data types, including text, images, audio, and video. The analysis of big data can
            provide valuable insights into patterns and trends, and can be used to inform business decisions,
            scientific research, and public policy.

    ChatGPT was notably missing nuance about the negative impacts of the processing of big data. It
    successfully described what big data is from a broad perspective, but it failed to address how the ability
    to store and process increasingly larger datasets allows for seemingly unintersting data can be used to infer
    highly sensitive information that can result in
