            <b>Query:</b> What is big data?
        </p>
        <blockquote cite="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">
            Big data refers to data that is larger, more complex, and more diverse than traditional data¹. It comes from different sources, such as computers, mobile devices, and sensors¹. It is hard to manage, store, and process with conventional tools¹. Big data can be used to drive decisions, improve processes, and create customer-centric products and services².<br><br>

            The term "big data" is often used interchangeably with "data science" or "data analytics"³. It has three main characteristics: volume (the amount of data), velocity (the speed at which data is generated), and variety (the different types of data)².<br><br>
            
            I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.<br><br>

        Bing Chat was much more specific in its descriptions of the main charactierstics of big data and similar
        fields of study; however, similar to ChatGPT, it neglected to contextualize the data rights framework of 
        big data which describes the impact on individuals' personal data. Since both ChatGPT and Bing Chat were

            trained on some form of digitized text datasets</a>, 
        their reponses to the query "What is big data?" reflect the dominant patterns in discussing the topic of 
        big data and highlight likely limitations in mainstream discussions of big data. The following series of
        blog posts is intended to demystify the process of big data collection, processing, and analysis, and then 
        discuss the effects of big data processing in Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications.
