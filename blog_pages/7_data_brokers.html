<h2>Data Brokers</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://epic.org/issues/consumer-privacy/data-brokers/">Data brokers</a> 
    are companies that buy, aggregate, disclose, and sell personal data. They sell to 
    a variety of entities including businesses, organizations, government agencies, 
    and other individuals. These companies function with almost no oversight and 
    have no requirement in the United States to disclose the data they collect or sell.
    Even worse, they have no legal obligation to obtain consent from the individuals 
    whose data they collect. 
    
    Data brokers that collect and distribute personally identifiable information (PII) 
    are referred to as <a href="https://privacyrights.org/resources/tutorial-data-brokers-and-people-search-sites">
        "people search engines/sites"</a>.
    <a href="https://www.dol.gov/general/ppii#:~:text=Personal%20Identifiable%20Information%20(PII)%20is,either%20direct%20or%20indirect%20means.">
        Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</a>
    refers to "Any representation of information that permits the identity of an individual to whom the information applies to be reasonably inferred by either direct or indirect means." This includes information such as your name, address, phone number, email address, social security number, and date of birth.
    
    They are often referred to as "people search engines" because they collect and sell data on individuals. Data brokers are not required to disclose the data they collect, and they are not required to obtain consent from the individuals whose data they collect. Data brokers are often used by employers, landlords, and lenders to make decisions about individuals. Data brokers are also used by law enforcement and government agencies to make decisions about individuals.
