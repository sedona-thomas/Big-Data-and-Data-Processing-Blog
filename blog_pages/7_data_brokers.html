<h2>Data Brokers</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://epic.org/issues/consumer-privacy/data-brokers/">Data brokers</a>
    are companies that buy, aggregate, disclose, and sell personal data. They sell to
    a variety of entities including businesses, organizations, government agencies,
    and other individuals. These companies function with almost no oversight and
    have no requirement in the United States to disclose the data they collect or sell.
    Even worse, they have no legal obligation to obtain consent from the individuals
    whose data they collect. Data broker services are often used by employers, landlords,
    lenders, law enforcement, and government agencies to help inform decisions about
    individuals. Some of the

<small>The discussion about "people search engines" was suggested by Github Copilot (Github's Natural language
    processing tool that uses the GPT-3 Large Language Model [LLM] like ChatGPT). All writing was done manually,
    but the suggested text was used to guide further research. Similarly, as I was creating the Kumu map, Github
    Copilot began suggesting data brokers with links to add to the map. All data brokers were manually verified 
    as legitimate sites and were noted to be aggragated by Copilot.
