<h2>Data Brokers Dataset</h2>
<p>
    Privacy Rights Clearinghouse is a nonprofit with the intention of increasing access to
    data privacy information and resources. They have compiled a comprehevsive dataset of
    data brokers that can be found at
    <a href="https://privacyrights.org/data-brokers">privacyrights.org</a>.
    There are currently 232 data brokers listed, but there are significantly more brokers
    actively aggragating and selling personal data. In California and Vermont alone, since
    enacting laws requiring data brokers to register with a state registry, there were
    <a href="https://privacyrights.org/resources/registered-data-brokers-united-states-2021">
        540 unique data brokers registered</a>
    by July 2021. Recent legislation has also been introduced in other states to require data
    brokers to register with a state registry, including <a
