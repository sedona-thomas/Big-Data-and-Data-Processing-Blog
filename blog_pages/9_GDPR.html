<h2>The GDPR</h2>
<p>
    The <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> is
    European Union law related to data protection and digital privacy. It was
    <a href="https://www.csis.org/blogs/strategic-technologies-blog/3-years-later-analysis-gdpr-enforcement">
        first adopted in 2016 and went into effect in 2018</a>. 
    The GDPR specifically covers the collection, storage, and processing of personal data. It is one 
    of the strictest and most comprehensive legislation related to the protection of individuals' 
    personal data and applies to 
    <a href="https://www.gdpreu.org/">any organization that handles the personal data of European 
        Union citizens</a>
    including those outside of EU member countries.

<h2>GDPR Additions to Already Existing Data Protectons in the EU</h2>
<p>The GDPR was specifically implemented to replace the 
    <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-protection-eu_en">
        Data Protection Directive</a> 
    which was adopted in 1995, a time when data processing capabilities were signifcantly limited 
    compared to today.  The GDPR was designed to address the shortcomings of the Data Protection 
    Directive by building upon the Data Protection Directive's protections of the free movement of 
    personal data by creating a new framework for three main actors in the use of big data: 
    <em>data subjects</em>, <em>data controllers</em>, and <em>data processors</em>.
