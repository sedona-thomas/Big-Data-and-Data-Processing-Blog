    The goals of this project are to contextualize mass data collection and data 
    processing within a human rights frame. The main actors will be the entities
    who collect data, who sell data, who buy data, and who process data. These 
    entities can be corporations, governments, or even individual people. 
    
    Specific algorithms tend to be framed as a technical problem and are often 
    discussed in a manner that is not able to be fully understood by people who 
    are not software engineers or computer scientists. Similarly, when discussed
    in the context of human rights, these issues are discussed at an extremely high 
    level.

    My main goal for this project is to take a deep dive into the most prominant 
    domains of artificial intelligence and machine learning with a focus on how the 
    design of specific algorithms affects human rights. Throughout this blog, there 
    will be (possibly interactive) demos of some of the machine learning models 
    currently in use throughout the digital world.
